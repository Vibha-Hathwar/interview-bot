Interview Bot Development with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
  The development of the interview bot involves :
Creatation of an interview bot that can assist individualsin evaluating their interview skills.
The bot aims to provide a realistic interview experience by asking random questions, evaluating user answers, and calculating a final score based on the similarity between the user's response and the expected answer.
The project also incorporates speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to enableusers to interact with the bot using voice commands.
  The interview bot uses an ML model to examine and contrast candidate responses with previously collected responses. The bot evaluates the similarity between the user's response and the expected answer using a combination of TF-IDF weighted vectors and Word2Vec embeddings. This similarity score is then used to calculate a final score for each question
